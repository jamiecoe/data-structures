# Data Structures

## What is a data structure?

> A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively

## Why are data structures useful to know?

Imagine you are given a task which includes creating an algorithm to manipulate an input array. Your solution works fine for a small input array of 5 elements...what about an input array of 1,000,000 elements? 

When working at scale, the **speed** and **efficiency** of your algorithms become very important. Learning about data-structures, and when to use them, can help improve both of these 👍  


## How do we measure speed/efficiency of our Algorithm?

## Different types of Data Structures

**Note:** *You will need to understand how to create an object with a constructor function in JS, and using the `this` keyword. I suggest doing the **Object Oriented Programming** section on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) beforehand if you are unfamiliar with these concepts.*
